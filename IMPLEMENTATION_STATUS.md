## 🐛 Known Issues / TODOs

- [ ] Need to start MongoDB before running backend
- [ ] File uploads directory needs to be created
- [ ] Need to add form validation on frontend
- [ ] Need to add retry logic for failed API calls
- [ ] Need to implement optimistic UI updates
- [ ] Need to add pagination for large task lists
- [ ] Need to add rate limiting on backend
- [ ] Need to add input sanitization
- [ ] Need to write tests
- [ ] Need to add deployment configuration

## 📝 Notes

This is a work in progress. The backend is fully functional and ready to use. The frontend needs context integration to connect to the backend API instead of localStorage.

The architecture is designed to support real-time collaboration, but currently only single-user scenarios are tested.

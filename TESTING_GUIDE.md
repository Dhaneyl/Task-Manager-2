# Testing Guide - Task Manager Full-Stack Integration

This guide will help you test the newly integrated full-stack Task Manager application.

---

## üöÄ Prerequisites

Before testing, ensure you have completed the setup:

1. **MongoDB is running** (local or MongoDB Atlas)
2. **Backend server is running** on port 5000
3. **Frontend dev server is running** on port 5173

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Testing

### Step 1: Start MongoDB

#### Local MongoDB:
```bash
# macOS
brew services start mongodb-community

# Linux
sudo systemctl start mongodb

# Windows
# MongoDB should start automatically as a service
# Or run: mongod
```

#### MongoDB Atlas (Cloud):
- Already running, just ensure your connection string is in `backend/.env`

---

### Step 2: Start Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Server running in development mode on port 5000
MongoDB Connected: localhost (or your Atlas cluster)
```

If you see these messages, the backend is ready! ‚úÖ

**Common Issues:**
- `Port 5000 already in use` ‚Üí Kill the process or change PORT in .env
- `MongoNetworkError` ‚Üí MongoDB is not running
- `Error: listen EADDRINUSE` ‚Üí Another app is using port 5000

---

### Step 3: Start Frontend Server

```bash
# In the project root
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
VITE v7.x.x  ready in xxx ms

  ‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ‚ûú  Network: use --host to expose
```

Open your browser to http://localhost:5173

## üîß Debugging Tools

### Browser DevTools

#### Network Tab (F12 ‚Üí Network)
**Check:**
- API requests to `http://localhost:5000/api/*`
- Response status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, etc.)
- Request/response payloads
- Authorization headers

**Example successful task creation:**
```
Request URL: http://localhost:5000/api/tasks
Request Method: POST
Status Code: 201 Created
Request Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGc...
Request Payload:
  {
    "title": "Test task",
    "description": "...",
    ...
  }
Response:
  {
    "success": true,
    "data": { ... }
  }
```

#### Console Tab
**Check for:**
- JavaScript errors (red text)
- Network errors
- API response logs
- Authentication status

#### Application Tab ‚Üí Local Storage
**Verify:**
- `token` exists (long JWT string)
- `user` exists (JSON object)

---

### Backend Logs

Watch backend terminal for:
- Request logs
- Error messages
- Database connection status
- Socket.io connections

---

### MongoDB Compass (Optional but Recommended)

1. **Download** [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)
2. **Connect** to `mongodb://localhost:27017`
3. **Browse** database `task-manager`
4. **View collections:**
   - users
   - tasks
   - categories
   - priorities
   - tags
   - notifications

**Visual verification** of data helps debug issues.

## ‚ùå Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Cannot connect to backend"
**Symptoms:** All API calls fail, toast shows connection errors

**Solutions:**
1. Check backend is running: `cd backend && npm run dev`
2. Check backend URL in `.env`: `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api`
3. Check CORS settings in `backend/src/server.ts`

---

### Issue 2: "401 Unauthorized"
**Symptoms:** Redirected to login, "Not authorized" errors

**Solutions:**
1. Token expired ‚Üí Log in again
2. Check Authorization header is being sent (Network tab)
3. Verify JWT_SECRET matches in backend `.env`

---

### Issue 3: "Tasks not appearing after creation"
**Symptoms:** Task created but list is empty

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify task was saved in MongoDB
3. Check if `loadAllData()` is called after login
4. Verify _id to id transformation in API interceptor

---

### Issue 4: "MongoDB connection failed"
**Symptoms:** Backend shows `MongoNetworkError`

**Solutions:**
1. Start MongoDB: `brew services start mongodb-community` (macOS)
2. Check MongoDB is listening on port 27017
3. Verify MONGO_URI in `backend/.env`

---

### Issue 5: "Port already in use"
**Symptoms:** `EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::5000`

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Find process using port 5000
lsof -i :5000

# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>

# Or change port in backend/.env
PORT=5001
```
